# Angular Bookshelf


An angular app for storing your books.  Your goal is to use angular to create a books app.  The app should be front end only (you do not need a working server). You are making the app almost from script.  Make sure you include all the correct css and javascript to get your app running.

## Hints

1. Look at some examples of submitting forms in angular.  Angular can group the data together nicely for you.
2. You may need to use new event handlers.  Check out event handlers in angular.
3. If you ever get lost, angular has great [docs](https://docs.angularjs.org/api) and [tutorials](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial).
